# C1
Challenge 1

The assignment challenge had the following criteria.
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
I accomplished the acceptance criteria by adding semantic HTML elements, a title, accessible alt attributes, changing the heading attributes to a sequential order and make sure the elements follow a logical order of structure.
